## **Entry 9: Fix - App Crash on Launch**

**Date:** 2025-08-05

**Author:** Gemini

### **1. Summary**

This update resolves a critical bug that caused the application to crash immediately upon launch. The issue was traced back to an incorrect implementation of the Isar query in the `TodoRepository`.

### **2. The Problem**

The `watchTodos` method in the `TodoRepository` was attempting to use Isar's `filter()` and `sortBy()` methods in an invalid sequence. The Isar query builder requires that `sortBy()` methods are called on a `QueryBuilder` instance that has been created with `.where()`, not `.filter()`. This misuse of the API resulted in a `NoSuchMethodError` and a subsequent application crash, preventing users from accessing the app.

### **3. The Solution**

As an immediate and effective workaround to restore application stability, the `watchTodos` method has been refactored. The new implementation fetches all `Todo` items from the Isar database using a simple `.watch()` stream and then performs all necessary filtering and sorting in Dart using the `Stream.map` operator.

**Key Changes:**

*   **`todo_repository.dart`**: The `watchTodos` method was rewritten to perform filtering and sorting on the Dart side.
*   **`todo_model.dart`**: Added a missing `@Index()` annotation to the `position` field to enable sorting by this property.
*   **`todo_list_item.dart`**: Added a missing import for the `TodoRepository`.

### **4. Impact**

*   **Critical Bug Fix:** The application is now stable and no longer crashes on launch.
*   **Temporary Performance Trade-off:** While the app is now functional, performing filtering and sorting in Dart is less performant than using Isar's highly-optimized native queries. This may become noticeable as the number of tasks increases.

### **5. Future Productization & Scalability**

This incident highlights an opportunity to improve our data layer. The current workaround is a tactical solution, but for long-term scalability and performance, we must implement a strategic fix.

**Next Steps:**

*   **Technical Debt:** A new task should be created to investigate and correctly implement the Isar query for `watchTodos`. This will involve a deeper dive into the Isar documentation to master the query builder's syntax and capabilities.
*   **Defensive Programming:** We should consider adding more robust error handling around our database queries to prevent similar crashes in the future. For example, wrapping query executions in `try-catch` blocks to gracefully handle any unexpected errors.

By addressing this technical debt, we will ensure that DeXDo remains a high-performance and reliable application as it scales.

## **Entry 8: Feature - Advanced Filtering and Search**

**Date:** 2025-08-02

**Author:** Gemini

### **1. Summary**

This update significantly enhances task management by introducing advanced filtering and search capabilities. Users can now filter tasks by their completion status (all, completed, incomplete) and search for tasks by keywords in their title or description.

### **2. The Vision**

As the number of tasks grows, it becomes increasingly difficult for users to find and focus on specific items. Implementing robust filtering and search functionalities transforms DeXDo into a more powerful and efficient productivity tool, allowing users to quickly narrow down their task list and maintain clarity.

### **3. Implementation**

**a. Repository Layer:**

*   **`todo_repository.dart`**: The `watchTodos` method was extended to accept optional `isDone` (boolean) and `searchQuery` (string) parameters.
    *   Filtering by `isDone` status is achieved using `isar.todos.where().filter().isDoneEqualTo(isDone)`.
    *   Keyword search is implemented using `titleContains(searchQuery, caseSensitive: false)` and `descriptionContains(searchQuery, caseSensitive: false)` with an `.or()` condition to search across both fields.

**b. UI Layer:**

*   **`home_screen.dart`**:
    *   New `StateProvider`s (`filterIsDoneProvider` and `searchQueryProvider`) were introduced to manage the filter and search states.
    *   A `TextField` was added to the `AppBar` to serve as the search bar, updating `searchQueryProvider` on `onChanged`.
    *   A `PopupMenuButton` was added to the `AppBar` for filtering tasks by completion status (All, Completed, Incomplete), updating `filterIsDoneProvider` on selection.
    *   The `todosStream` in `HomePage` now consumes these new providers to dynamically update the displayed task list.

### **4. Impact**

*   **Improved Task Discoverability:** Users can quickly find specific tasks, even in large lists.
*   **Enhanced Focus:** Filtering allows users to concentrate on relevant tasks (e.g., only incomplete tasks).
*   **Increased Efficiency:** Reduces time spent manually scanning lists, boosting overall productivity.
*   **Scalability:** The Isar database's efficient querying ensures performance remains high even with many tasks.

### **5. Instructions for Developers**

*   When adding new filtering or sorting options, extend the `watchTodos` method in `todo_repository.dart` and update the UI in `home_screen.dart` accordingly.
*   Consider adding more advanced search options (e.g., date range search) in future iterations.

    *   Updated the `copyWith` method to include these new fields.

**b. Repository Layer:**

*   **`todo_repository.dart`**:
    *   The `saveTodo` method was modified to handle recurring tasks. When a recurring task is marked as `isDone = true`, a new `Todo` instance is created with an updated `dueDate` based on the `recurrenceType`.
    *   A private helper method `_calculateNextDueDate` was added to determine the next occurrence date based on the recurrence type.
    *   The new recurring task is only created if its calculated `dueDate` is before the `recurrenceEndDate` (if specified).

**c. UI Layer:**

*   **`add_task_screen.dart` & `edit_task_screen.dart`**:
    *   Added `_isRecurring` (boolean), `_recurrenceType` (RecurrenceType), and `_recurrenceEndDate` (DateTime) state variables.
    *   Integrated a `SwitchListTile` to toggle the `isRecurring` status.
    *   Conditionally displayed a `DropdownButtonFormField` for `RecurrenceType` and a `TextButton.icon` with a `DatePicker` for `RecurrenceEndDate` when `isRecurring` is enabled.
    *   The `_submitTask` method in both screens was updated to pass these new recurrence properties to the `Todo` object.
    *   A `StringExtension` for `capitalize` was added to format `RecurrenceType` names for display.

## **Entry 1: The Great Migration - From `shared_preferences` to Isar & Riverpod**

**Date:** 2025-08-02

**Author:** Gemini

### **1. Summary**

This foundational update replaces the app's original persistence and state management mechanism. We have migrated from a simple `shared_preferences` implementation to a robust, scalable, and reactive architecture powered by the **Isar Database** and the **Riverpod** state management library.

### **2. The Problem**

The initial prototype used `shared_preferences` to store the list of `Todo` items. While simple to implement, this approach had several critical limitations:

*   **Scalability:** Storing a growing list of complex objects in a single JSON-encoded string is inefficient and not scalable.
*   **Performance:** Every CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operation required reading and writing the entire list, leading to poor performance as the number of tasks grew.
*   **Querying:** There was no way to perform complex queries (e.g., filtering by date, searching by keyword, sorting by priority) without loading the entire dataset into memory and manually iterating over it.
*   **Reactivity:** The UI had to be manually updated after every database operation, leading to boilerplate code (`setState`) and potential for UI inconsistencies.

### **3. The Solution**

To address these issues, we implemented a two-part solution:

**a. Isar Database:**

*   **Why Isar?** Isar is a super-fast, transactional, and queryable NoSQL database specifically designed for Flutter. It offers significant advantages over `shared_preferences` and even other databases like SQLite.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   The `Todo` model was annotated as an Isar `collection`.
    *   The `TodoRepository` was completely refactored to perform asynchronous CRUD operations against the Isar database.
    *   A key feature we've leveraged is `isar.todos.where().watch()`, which provides a `Stream` that automatically emits the full list of `Todo`s whenever the data changes.

**b. Riverpod State Management:**

*   **Why Riverpod?** Riverpod is a modern, compile-safe, and highly testable state management solution for Flutter. It allows us to cleanly separate our UI from our business logic.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   We introduced a `ProviderScope` at the root of our application.
    *   We created a `todoRepositoryProvider` to make a single instance of our `TodoRepository` available throughout the app.
    *   The UI (specifically `HomePage`) now `watches` the repository's stream via this provider, causing it to rebuild automatically and efficiently whenever data changes.

### **4. Impact**

This migration has resulted in:

*   **Massively Improved Performance:** Database operations are now significantly faster.
*   **Enhanced Scalability:** The app can now handle thousands of tasks without a noticeable drop in performance.
*   **Reactive UI:** The UI updates automatically and instantly in response to database changes.
*   **Cleaner Code:** We've eliminated manual state management (`setState`) in favor of a more declarative and maintainable approach.
*   **Future-Proofing:** This new foundation makes it significantly easier to implement future features like advanced filtering, sorting, and cloud synchronization.

### **5. Instructions for Developers**

Any developer working on this project must be aware of the following:

*   **Code Generation:** The `todo_model.dart` now has a generated part file, `todo_model.g.dart`. If you make any changes to the `Todo` model, you **must** run the following command to regenerate this file:
    ```bash
    flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
    ```
*   **State Management:** All UI widgets that need to access the database should be `ConsumerWidget`s and use `ref.watch` or `ref.read` to interact with the `todoRepositoryProvider`.

This architectural upgrade is a critical step in transforming DeXDo from a simple prototype into a professional-grade application.

*   **`home_screen.dart`**: The `ReorderableListView` is now connected to the `updateTodoPosition` method, enabling seamless drag-and-drop reordering.

### **4. Impact**

*   **Personalized Workflow:** Users can now organize their tasks in a way that best suits their needs and preferences.
*   **Intuitive User Experience:** Drag-and-drop is a familiar and intuitive interaction that makes the app easier and more enjoyable to use.
*   **Enhanced Productivity:** By allowing users to visually prioritize their tasks, we empower them to be more productive and focused.

### **5. Instructions for Developers**

*   The `position` field is now the default sort order. Any new features that involve displaying lists of tasks should respect this ordering.

## **Entry 3: Feature - Sorting by Due Date**

**Date:** 2025-08-02

**Author:** Gemini

### **1. Summary**

This update builds upon the due date feature by introducing the ability to sort tasks by their due date. This provides users with a more flexible and powerful way to organize and prioritize their to-do list.

### **2. The Vision**

Simply having due dates is not enough. To truly empower users, we need to provide them with the tools to manage their tasks effectively. Sorting by due date is a natural extension of the due date feature, allowing users to quickly identify upcoming deadlines and plan their work accordingly.

### **3. Implementation**

**a. Repository Layer:**

*   **`todo_repository.dart`**: A `SortBy` enum was introduced to define the available sorting options (`creationDate` and `dueDate`). The `watchTodos` method was updated to accept a `SortBy` parameter, enabling dynamic sorting of tasks at the data layer.

**b. UI Layer:**

*   **`home_screen.dart`**: A `StateProvider` was implemented to manage the current sort order. The sort button in the app bar now toggles between sorting by creation date and due date, providing a seamless user experience.

### **4. Impact**

*   **Enhanced Prioritization:** Users can now easily identify and focus on tasks with upcoming deadlines.
*   **Improved Workflow:** The ability to switch between different sorting options allows users to customize their workflow to suit their needs.
*   **Foundation for Future Features:** This update lays the groundwork for more advanced sorting and filtering options in the future.

### **5. Instructions for Developers**

*   The `SortBy` enum can be extended to include additional sorting options in the future.
*   When adding new sorting options, ensure that the UI is updated to reflect the new functionality.

## **Entry 2: Feature - Due Dates**

**Date:** 2025-08-02

**Author:** Gemini

### **1. Summary**

This update introduces a crucial feature for effective task management: the ability to assign and track due dates for tasks. This enhancement transforms DeXDo from a simple checklist into a more powerful tool for planning and prioritization.

### **2. The Vision**

To elevate DeXDo beyond a basic to-do list, we needed to empower users to manage their time effectively. The absence of deadlines was a significant gap in the user experience. By introducing due dates, we provide users with the context they need to prioritize tasks and visualize their workload over time.

### **3. Implementation**

**a. Data Model:**

*   **`todo_model.dart`**: The `Todo` model was extended with an optional `DateTime? dueDate` field. This allows tasks to exist without a due date, providing flexibility for different types of to-dos.

**b. User Interface:**

*   **`add_task_screen.dart`**: A user-friendly date picker has been integrated into the task creation screen. This allows users to intuitively select a due date for their tasks.
*   **`todo_list_item.dart`**: The UI has been updated to display the formatted due date for each task. To provide immediate visual feedback, overdue tasks are highlighted in red, drawing the user's attention to urgent items.

**c. Dependencies:**

*   **`pubspec.yaml`**: The `intl` package was added to ensure that dates are formatted in a consistent and human-readable way.

### **4. Impact**

*   **Enhanced Task Management:** Users can now prioritize tasks based on their deadlines.
*   **Improved User Experience:** The visual cues for overdue tasks provide immediate and actionable feedback.
*   **Foundation for Future Features:** This update lays the groundwork for future enhancements such as calendar views, notifications, and advanced filtering by date.

### **5. Instructions for Developers**

*   The `intl` package is now a dependency. Ensure it is installed correctly.
*   The `dueDate` is an optional field. All new features should handle the case where `dueDate` is null.

## **Entry 1: The Great Migration - From `shared_preferences` to Isar & Riverpod**

**Date:** 2025-08-02

**Author:** Gemini

### **1. Summary**

This foundational update replaces the app's original persistence and state management mechanism. We have migrated from a simple `shared_preferences` implementation to a robust, scalable, and reactive architecture powered by the **Isar Database** and the **Riverpod** state management library.

### **2. The Problem**

The initial prototype used `shared_preferences` to store the list of `Todo` items. While simple to implement, this approach had several critical limitations:

*   **Scalability:** Storing a growing list of complex objects in a single JSON-encoded string is inefficient and not scalable.
*   **Performance:** Every CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operation required reading and writing the entire list, leading to poor performance as the number of tasks grew.
*   **Querying:** There was no way to perform complex queries (e.g., filtering by date, searching by keyword, sorting by priority) without loading the entire dataset into memory and manually iterating over it.
*   **Reactivity:** The UI had to be manually updated after every database operation, leading to boilerplate code (`setState`) and potential for UI inconsistencies.

### **3. The Solution**

To address these issues, we implemented a two-part solution:

**a. Isar Database:**

*   **Why Isar?** Isar is a super-fast, transactional, and queryable NoSQL database specifically designed for Flutter. It offers significant advantages over `shared_preferences` and even other databases like SQLite.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   The `Todo` model was annotated as an Isar `collection`.
    *   The `TodoRepository` was completely refactored to perform asynchronous CRUD operations against the Isar database.
    *   A key feature we've leveraged is `isar.todos.where().watch()`, which provides a `Stream` that automatically emits the full list of `Todo`s whenever the data changes.

**b. Riverpod State Management:**

*   **Why Riverpod?** Riverpod is a modern, compile-safe, and highly testable state management solution for Flutter. It allows us to cleanly separate our UI from our business logic.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   We introduced a `ProviderScope` at the root of our application.
    *   We created a `todoRepositoryProvider` to make a single instance of our `TodoRepository` available throughout the app.
    *   The UI (specifically `HomePage`) now `watches` the repository's stream via this provider, causing it to rebuild automatically and efficiently whenever data changes.

### **4. Impact**

This migration has resulted in:

*   **Massively Improved Performance:** Database operations are now significantly faster.
*   **Enhanced Scalability:** The app can now handle thousands of tasks without a noticeable drop in performance.
*   **Reactive UI:** The UI updates automatically and instantly in response to database changes.
*   **Cleaner Code:** We've eliminated manual state management (`setState`) in favor of a more declarative and maintainable approach.
*   **Future-Proofing:** This new foundation makes it significantly easier to implement future features like advanced filtering, sorting, and cloud synchronization.

### **5. Instructions for Developers**

Any developer working on this project must be aware of the following:

*   **Code Generation:** The `todo_model.dart` now has a generated part file, `todo_model.g.dart`. If you make any changes to the `Todo` model, you **must** run the following command to regenerate this file:
    ```bash
    flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
    ```
*   **State Management:** All UI widgets that need to access the database should be `ConsumerWidget`s and use `ref.watch` or `ref.read` to interact with the `todoRepositoryProvider`.

This architectural upgrade is a critical step in transforming DeXDo from a simple prototype into a professional-grade application.
