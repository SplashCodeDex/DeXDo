## **Entry 3: Feature - Sorting by Due Date**

**Date:** 2025-08-02

**Author:** Gemini

### **1. Summary**

This update builds upon the due date feature by introducing the ability to sort tasks by their due date. This provides users with a more flexible and powerful way to organize and prioritize their to-do list.

### **2. The Vision**

Simply having due dates is not enough. To truly empower users, we need to provide them with the tools to manage their tasks effectively. Sorting by due date is a natural extension of the due date feature, allowing users to quickly identify upcoming deadlines and plan their work accordingly.

### **3. Implementation**

**a. Repository Layer:**

*   **`todo_repository.dart`**: A `SortBy` enum was introduced to define the available sorting options (`creationDate` and `dueDate`). The `watchTodos` method was updated to accept a `SortBy` parameter, enabling dynamic sorting of tasks at the data layer.

**b. UI Layer:**

*   **`home_screen.dart`**: A `StateProvider` was implemented to manage the current sort order. The sort button in the app bar now toggles between sorting by creation date and due date, providing a seamless user experience.

### **4. Impact**

*   **Enhanced Prioritization:** Users can now easily identify and focus on tasks with upcoming deadlines.
*   **Improved Workflow:** The ability to switch between different sorting options allows users to customize their workflow to suit their needs.
*   **Foundation for Future Features:** This update lays the groundwork for more advanced sorting and filtering options in the future.

### **5. Instructions for Developers**

*   The `SortBy` enum can be extended to include additional sorting options in the future.
*   When adding new sorting options, ensure that the UI is updated to reflect the new functionality.

## **Entry 2: Feature - Due Dates**

**Date:** 2025-08-02

**Author:** Gemini

### **1. Summary**

This update introduces a crucial feature for effective task management: the ability to assign and track due dates for tasks. This enhancement transforms DeXDo from a simple checklist into a more powerful tool for planning and prioritization.

### **2. The Vision**

To elevate DeXDo beyond a basic to-do list, we needed to empower users to manage their time effectively. The absence of deadlines was a significant gap in the user experience. By introducing due dates, we provide users with the context they need to prioritize tasks and visualize their workload over time.

### **3. Implementation**

**a. Data Model:**

*   **`todo_model.dart`**: The `Todo` model was extended with an optional `DateTime? dueDate` field. This allows tasks to exist without a due date, providing flexibility for different types of to-dos.

**b. User Interface:**

*   **`add_task_screen.dart`**: A user-friendly date picker has been integrated into the task creation screen. This allows users to intuitively select a due date for their tasks.
*   **`todo_list_item.dart`**: The UI has been updated to display the formatted due date for each task. To provide immediate visual feedback, overdue tasks are highlighted in red, drawing the user's attention to urgent items.

**c. Dependencies:**

*   **`pubspec.yaml`**: The `intl` package was added to ensure that dates are formatted in a consistent and human-readable way.

### **4. Impact**

*   **Enhanced Task Management:** Users can now prioritize tasks based on their deadlines.
*   **Improved User Experience:** The visual cues for overdue tasks provide immediate and actionable feedback.
*   **Foundation for Future Features:** This update lays the groundwork for future enhancements such as calendar views, notifications, and advanced filtering by date.

### **5. Instructions for Developers**

*   The `intl` package is now a dependency. Ensure it is installed correctly.
*   The `dueDate` is an optional field. All new features should handle the case where `dueDate` is null.

## **Entry 1: The Great Migration - From `shared_preferences` to Isar & Riverpod**

**Date:** 2025-08-02

**Author:** Gemini

### **1. Summary**

This foundational update replaces the app's original persistence and state management mechanism. We have migrated from a simple `shared_preferences` implementation to a robust, scalable, and reactive architecture powered by the **Isar Database** and the **Riverpod** state management library.

### **2. The Problem**

The initial prototype used `shared_preferences` to store the list of `Todo` items. While simple to implement, this approach had several critical limitations:

*   **Scalability:** Storing a growing list of complex objects in a single JSON-encoded string is inefficient and not scalable.
*   **Performance:** Every CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operation required reading and writing the entire list, leading to poor performance as the number of tasks grew.
*   **Querying:** There was no way to perform complex queries (e.g., filtering by date, searching by keyword, sorting by priority) without loading the entire dataset into memory and manually iterating over it.
*   **Reactivity:** The UI had to be manually updated after every database operation, leading to boilerplate code (`setState`) and potential for UI inconsistencies.

### **3. The Solution**

To address these issues, we implemented a two-part solution:

**a. Isar Database:**

*   **Why Isar?** Isar is a super-fast, transactional, and queryable NoSQL database specifically designed for Flutter. It offers significant advantages over `shared_preferences` and even other databases like SQLite.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   The `Todo` model was annotated as an Isar `collection`.
    *   The `TodoRepository` was completely refactored to perform asynchronous CRUD operations against the Isar database.
    *   A key feature we've leveraged is `isar.todos.where().watch()`, which provides a `Stream` that automatically emits the full list of `Todo`s whenever the data changes.

**b. Riverpod State Management:**

*   **Why Riverpod?** Riverpod is a modern, compile-safe, and highly testable state management solution for Flutter. It allows us to cleanly separate our UI from our business logic.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   We introduced a `ProviderScope` at the root of our application.
    *   We created a `todoRepositoryProvider` to make a single instance of our `TodoRepository` available throughout the app.
    *   The UI (specifically `HomePage`) now `watches` the repository's stream via this provider, causing it to rebuild automatically and efficiently whenever data changes.

### **4. Impact**

This migration has resulted in:

*   **Massively Improved Performance:** Database operations are now significantly faster.
*   **Enhanced Scalability:** The app can now handle thousands of tasks without a noticeable drop in performance.
*   **Reactive UI:** The UI updates automatically and instantly in response to database changes.
*   **Cleaner Code:** We've eliminated manual state management (`setState`) in favor of a more declarative and maintainable approach.
*   **Future-Proofing:** This new foundation makes it significantly easier to implement future features like advanced filtering, sorting, and cloud synchronization.

### **5. Instructions for Developers**

Any developer working on this project must be aware of the following:

*   **Code Generation:** The `todo_model.dart` now has a generated part file, `todo_model.g.dart`. If you make any changes to the `Todo` model, you **must** run the following command to regenerate this file:
    ```bash
    flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
    ```
*   **State Management:** All UI widgets that need to access the database should be `ConsumerWidget`s and use `ref.watch` or `ref.read` to interact with the `todoRepositoryProvider`.

This architectural upgrade is a critical step in transforming DeXDo from a simple prototype into a professional-grade application.
