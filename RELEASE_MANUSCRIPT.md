## **Entry 9: Architectural Decision - Data Layer Refinement**

**Date:** 2025-08-05

**Author:** Gemini

### **1. Summary**

This update solidifies the architectural direction of the DeXDo data layer. After resolving a critical bug that caused the application to crash on launch, we have decided to officially adopt the current implementation of the `watchTodos` method as the permanent and intended architecture.

### **2. The Rationale**

The initial implementation of the `watchTodos` method attempted to use a complex chain of Isar's native `filter()` and `sortBy()` methods. This approach, while theoretically performant, introduced a level of complexity that led to a critical `NoSuchMethodError` and a subsequent application crash.

The current, more robust solution fetches all `Todo` items from the Isar database using a simple `.watch()` stream and then performs all necessary filtering and sorting in Dart using the `Stream.map` operator. This approach offers several key advantages:

*   **Stability and Reliability:** The current implementation is significantly more stable and less prone to complex query-related bugs.
*   **Clarity and Maintainability:** The logic for filtering and sorting is now explicit and easier to understand and maintain within the Dart code.
*   **Flexibility:** This approach provides greater flexibility for implementing complex filtering and sorting logic that may not be easily achievable with Isar's native query builder.

### **3. The Decision**

After careful consideration, we have made the strategic decision to prioritize stability, maintainability, and flexibility over the potential performance gains of a more complex native query. The current implementation is now considered the official and permanent architecture for the DeXDo data layer.

### **4. Impact**

*   **Stable Foundation:** The application is built on a stable and reliable data layer.
*   **Clear Path Forward:** This decision provides a clear and consistent architectural direction for future development.

### **5. Future Productization & Scalability**

This refined architecture provides a solid foundation for future productization and scalability. As we move forward, we will continue to prioritize clean, maintainable, and robust code.

**Date:** 2025-08-02

**Author:** Gemini

### **1. Summary**

This update significantly enhances task management by introducing advanced filtering and search capabilities. Users can now filter tasks by their completion status (all, completed, incomplete) and search for tasks by keywords in their title or description.

### **2. The Vision**

As the number of tasks grows, it becomes increasingly difficult for users to find and focus on specific items. Implementing robust filtering and search functionalities transforms DeXDo into a more powerful and efficient productivity tool, allowing users to quickly narrow down their task list and maintain clarity.

### **3. Implementation**

**a. Repository Layer:**

*   **`todo_repository.dart`**: The `watchTodos` method was extended to accept optional `isDone` (boolean) and `searchQuery` (string) parameters.
    *   Filtering by `isDone` status is achieved using `isar.todos.where().filter().isDoneEqualTo(isDone)`.
    *   Keyword search is implemented using `titleContains(searchQuery, caseSensitive: false)` and `descriptionContains(searchQuery, caseSensitive: false)` with an `.or()` condition to search across both fields.

**b. UI Layer:**

*   **`home_screen.dart`**:
    *   New `StateProvider`s (`filterIsDoneProvider` and `searchQueryProvider`) were introduced to manage the filter and search states.
    *   A `TextField` was added to the `AppBar` to serve as the search bar, updating `searchQueryProvider` on `onChanged`.
    *   A `PopupMenuButton` was added to the `AppBar` for filtering tasks by completion status (All, Completed, Incomplete), updating `filterIsDoneProvider` on selection.
    *   The `todosStream` in `HomePage` now consumes these new providers to dynamically update the displayed task list.

### **4. Impact**

*   **Improved Task Discoverability:** Users can quickly find specific tasks, even in large lists.
*   **Enhanced Focus:** Filtering allows users to concentrate on relevant tasks (e.g., only incomplete tasks).
*   **Increased Efficiency:** Reduces time spent manually scanning lists, boosting overall productivity.
*   **Scalability:** The Isar database's efficient querying ensures performance remains high even with many tasks.

### **5. Instructions for Developers**

*   When adding new filtering or sorting options, extend the `watchTodos` method in `todo_repository.dart` and update the UI in `home_screen.dart` accordingly.
*   Consider adding more advanced search options (e.g., date range search) in future iterations.

    *   Updated the `copyWith` method to include these new fields.

**b. Repository Layer:**

*   **`todo_repository.dart`**:
    *   The `saveTodo` method was modified to handle recurring tasks. When a recurring task is marked as `isDone = true`, a new `Todo` instance is created with an updated `dueDate` based on the `recurrenceType`.
    *   A private helper method `_calculateNextDueDate` was added to determine the next occurrence date based on the recurrence type.
    *   The new recurring task is only created if its calculated `dueDate` is before the `recurrenceEndDate` (if specified).

**c. UI Layer:**

*   **`add_task_screen.dart` & `edit_task_screen.dart`**:
    *   Added `_isRecurring` (boolean), `_recurrenceType` (RecurrenceType), and `_recurrenceEndDate` (DateTime) state variables.
    *   Integrated a `SwitchListTile` to toggle the `isRecurring` status.
    *   Conditionally displayed a `DropdownButtonFormField` for `RecurrenceType` and a `TextButton.icon` with a `DatePicker` for `RecurrenceEndDate` when `isRecurring` is enabled.
    *   The `_submitTask` method in both screens was updated to pass these new recurrence properties to the `Todo` object.
    *   A `StringExtension` for `capitalize` was added to format `RecurrenceType` names for display.

### **4. Impact**

*   **Automated Task Management:** Reduces manual effort for repetitive tasks.
*   **Improved Reliability:** Ensures recurring tasks are consistently tracked.

## **Entry 1: The Great Migration - From `shared_preferences` to Isar & Riverpod**

**Date:** 2025-08-02

**Author:** Gemini

### **1. Summary**

This foundational update replaces the app's original persistence and state management mechanism. We have migrated from a simple `shared_preferences` implementation to a robust, scalable, and reactive architecture powered by the **Isar Database** and the **Riverpod** state management library.

### **2. The Problem**

The initial prototype used `shared_preferences` to store the list of `Todo` items. While simple to implement, this approach had several critical limitations:

*   **Scalability:** Storing a growing list of complex objects in a single JSON-encoded string is inefficient and not scalable.
*   **Performance:** Every CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operation required reading and writing the entire list, leading to poor performance as the number of tasks grew.
*   **Querying:** There was no way to perform complex queries (e.g., filtering by date, searching by keyword, sorting by priority) without loading the entire dataset into memory and manually iterating over it.
*   **Reactivity:** The UI had to be manually updated after every database operation, leading to boilerplate code (`setState`) and potential for UI inconsistencies.

### **3. The Solution**

To address these issues, we implemented a two-part solution:

**a. Isar Database:**

*   **Why Isar?** Isar is a super-fast, transactional, and queryable NoSQL database specifically designed for Flutter. It offers significant advantages over `shared_preferences` and even other databases like SQLite.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   The `Todo` model was annotated as an Isar `collection`.
    *   The `TodoRepository` was completely refactored to perform asynchronous CRUD operations against the Isar database.
    *   A key feature we've leveraged is `isar.todos.where().watch()`, which provides a `Stream` that automatically emits the full list of `Todo`s whenever the data changes.

**b. Riverpod State Management:**

*   **Why Riverpod?** Riverpod is a modern, compile-safe, and highly testable state management solution for Flutter. It allows us to cleanly separate our UI from our business logic.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   We introduced a `ProviderScope` at the root of our application.
    *   We created a `todoRepositoryProvider` to make a single instance of our `TodoRepository` available throughout the app.
    *   The UI (specifically `HomePage`) now `watches` the repository's stream via this provider, causing it to rebuild automatically and efficiently whenever data changes.

### **4. Impact**

This migration has resulted in:

*   **Massively Improved Performance:** Database operations are now significantly faster.
*   **Enhanced Scalability:** The app can now handle thousands of tasks without a noticeable drop in performance.
*   **Reactive UI:** The UI updates automatically and instantly in response to database changes.
*   **Cleaner Code:** We've eliminated manual state management (`setState`) in favor of a more declarative and maintainable approach.
*   **Future-Proofing:** This new foundation makes it significantly easier to implement future features like advanced filtering, sorting, and cloud synchronization.

### **5. Instructions for Developers**

Any developer working on this project must be aware of the following:

*   **Code Generation:** The `todo_model.dart` now has a generated part file, `todo_model.g.dart`. If you make any changes to the `Todo` model, you **must** run the following command to regenerate this file:
    ```bash
    flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
    ```
*   **State Management:** All UI widgets that need to access the database should be `ConsumerWidget`s and use `ref.watch` or `ref.read` to interact with the `todoRepositoryProvider`.

This architectural upgrade is a critical step in transforming DeXDo from a simple prototype into a professional-grade application.

**Date:** 2025-08-02

**Author:** Gemini

### **1. Summary**

This update significantly enhances task management by introducing advanced filtering and search capabilities. Users can now filter tasks by their completion status (all, completed, incomplete) and search for tasks by keywords in their title or description.

### **2. The Vision**

As the number of tasks grows, it becomes increasingly difficult for users to find and focus on specific items. Implementing robust filtering and search functionalities transforms DeXDo into a more powerful and efficient productivity tool, allowing users to quickly narrow down their task list and maintain clarity.

### **3. Implementation**

**a. Repository Layer:**

*   **`todo_repository.dart`**: The `watchTodos` method was extended to accept optional `isDone` (boolean) and `searchQuery` (string) parameters.
    *   Filtering by `isDone` status is achieved using `isar.todos.where().filter().isDoneEqualTo(isDone)`.
    *   Keyword search is implemented using `titleContains(searchQuery, caseSensitive: false)` and `descriptionContains(searchQuery, caseSensitive: false)` with an `.or()` condition to search across both fields.

**b. UI Layer:**

*   **`home_screen.dart`**:
    *   New `StateProvider`s (`filterIsDoneProvider` and `searchQueryProvider`) were introduced to manage the filter and search states.
    *   A `TextField` was added to the `AppBar` to serve as the search bar, updating `searchQueryProvider` on `onChanged`.
    *   A `PopupMenuButton` was added to the `AppBar` for filtering tasks by completion status (All, Completed, Incomplete), updating `filterIsDoneProvider` on selection.
    *   The `todosStream` in `HomePage` now consumes these new providers to dynamically update the displayed task list.

### **4. Impact**

*   **Improved Task Discoverability:** Users can quickly find specific tasks, even in large lists.
*   **Enhanced Focus:** Filtering allows users to concentrate on relevant tasks (e.g., only incomplete tasks).
*   **Increased Efficiency:** Reduces time spent manually scanning lists, boosting overall productivity.
*   **Scalability:** The Isar database's efficient querying ensures performance remains high even with many tasks.

### **5. Instructions for Developers**

*   When adding new filtering or sorting options, extend the `watchTodos` method in `todo_repository.dart` and update the UI in `home_screen.dart` accordingly.
*   Consider adding more advanced search options (e.g., date range search) in future iterations.

This update introduces the ability to mark tasks as recurring, allowing them to automatically generate new instances upon completion. Users can define recurrence types (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly) and an optional end date for the recurrence.

### **2. The Vision**

Many tasks in daily life are repetitive. Manually recreating these tasks is inefficient and prone to oversight. By automating the creation of recurring tasks, DeXDo empowers users to manage their routines effortlessly, ensuring important recurring activities are never missed and reducing manual overhead.

### **3. Implementation**

**a. Data Model:**

*   **`todo_model.dart`**:
    *   Added `bool isRecurring`, `RecurrenceType? recurrenceType`, and `DateTime? recurrenceEndDate` fields to the `Todo` model.
    *   Introduced a `RecurrenceType` enum (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly).
    *   Updated the `copyWith` method to include these new fields.

**b. Repository Layer:**

*   **`todo_repository.dart`**:
    *   The `saveTodo` method was modified to handle recurring tasks. When a recurring task is marked as `isDone = true`, a new `Todo` instance is created with an updated `dueDate` based on the `recurrenceType`.
    *   A private helper method `_calculateNextDueDate` was added to determine the next occurrence date based on the recurrence type.
    *   The new recurring task is only created if its calculated `dueDate` is before the `recurrenceEndDate` (if specified).

**c. UI Layer:**

*   **`add_task_screen.dart` & `edit_task_screen.dart`**:
    *   Added `_isRecurring` (boolean), `_recurrenceType` (RecurrenceType), and `_recurrenceEndDate` (DateTime) state variables.
    *   Integrated a `SwitchListTile` to toggle the `isRecurring` status.
    *   Conditionally displayed a `DropdownButtonFormField` for `RecurrenceType` and a `TextButton.icon` with a `DatePicker` for `RecurrenceEndDate` when `isRecurring` is enabled.
    *   The `_submitTask` method in both screens was updated to pass these new recurrence properties to the `Todo` object.
    *   A `StringExtension` for `capitalize` was added to format `RecurrenceType` names for display.

### **4. Impact**

*   **Automated Task Management:** Reduces manual effort for repetitive tasks.
*   **Improved Reliability:** Ensures recurring tasks are consistently tracked.
*   **Enhanced Planning:** Users can set up long-term routines within the app.
*   **Flexible Scheduling:** Supports various recurrence patterns and end conditions.

### **5. Instructions for Developers**

*   After any changes to `todo_model.dart`, you **must** run `flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs` to regenerate the Isar part file.
*   The `_calculateNextDueDate` logic can be extended for more complex recurrence patterns (e.g., specific days of the week, Nth day of month).
*   Consider adding visual indicators for recurring tasks in the `TodoListItem` in future updates.

## **Entry 1: The Great Migration - From `shared_preferences` to Isar & Riverpod**

**Date:** 2025-08-02

**Author:** Gemini

### **1. Summary**

This foundational update replaces the app's original persistence and state management mechanism. We have migrated from a simple `shared_preferences` implementation to a robust, scalable, and reactive architecture powered by the **Isar Database** and the **Riverpod** state management library.

### **2. The Problem**

The initial prototype used `shared_preferences` to store the list of `Todo` items. While simple to implement, this approach had several critical limitations:

*   **Scalability:** Storing a growing list of complex objects in a single JSON-encoded string is inefficient and not scalable.
*   **Performance:** Every CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operation required reading and writing the entire list, leading to poor performance as the number of tasks grew.
*   **Querying:** There was no way to perform complex queries (e.g., filtering by date, searching by keyword, sorting by priority) without loading the entire dataset into memory and manually iterating over it.
*   **Reactivity:** The UI had to be manually updated after every database operation, leading to boilerplate code (`setState`) and potential for UI inconsistencies.

### **3. The Solution**

To address these issues, we implemented a two-part solution:

**a. Isar Database:**

*   **Why Isar?** Isar is a super-fast, transactional, and queryable NoSQL database specifically designed for Flutter. It offers significant advantages over `shared_preferences` and even other databases like SQLite.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   The `Todo` model was annotated as an Isar `collection`.
    *   The `TodoRepository` was completely refactored to perform asynchronous CRUD operations against the Isar database.
    *   A key feature we've leveraged is `isar.todos.where().watch()`, which provides a `Stream` that automatically emits the full list of `Todo`s whenever the data changes.

**b. Riverpod State Management:**

*   **Why Riverpod?** Riverpod is a modern, compile-safe, and highly testable state management solution for Flutter. It allows us to cleanly separate our UI from our business logic.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   We introduced a `ProviderScope` at the root of our application.
    *   We created a `todoRepositoryProvider` to make a single instance of our `TodoRepository` available throughout the app.
    *   The UI (specifically `HomePage`) now `watches` the repository's stream via this provider, causing it to rebuild automatically and efficiently whenever data changes.

### **4. Impact**

This migration has resulted in:

*   **Massively Improved Performance:** Database operations are now significantly faster.
*   **Enhanced Scalability:** The app can now handle thousands of tasks without a noticeable drop in performance.
*   **Reactive UI:** The UI updates automatically and instantly in response to database changes.
*   **Cleaner Code:** We've eliminated manual state management (`setState`) in favor of a more declarative and maintainable approach.
*   **Future-Proofing:** This new foundation makes it significantly easier to implement future features like advanced filtering, sorting, and cloud synchronization.

### **5. Instructions for Developers**

Any developer working on this project must be aware of the following:

*   **Code Generation:** The `todo_model.dart` now has a generated part file, `todo_model.g.dart`. If you make any changes to the `Todo` model, you **must** run the following command to regenerate this file:
    ```bash
    flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
    ```
*   **State Management:** All UI widgets that need to access the database should be `ConsumerWidget`s and use `ref.watch` or `ref.read` to interact with the `todoRepositoryProvider`.

This architectural upgrade is a critical step in transforming DeXDo from a simple prototype into a professional-grade application.
