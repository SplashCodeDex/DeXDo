# DeXDo: The To-Do App that gets things done!

DeXDo is a simple and intuitive to-do application designed to help you stay organized and productive.

## Features

*   **Create and Manage Tasks:** Easily add, edit, and delete tasks.
*   **Due Dates:** Assign due dates to your tasks to stay on track.
*   **Sort by Due Date:** Sort your tasks by due date to prioritize your work.
*   **Drag-and-Drop Reordering:** Manually reorder your tasks to fit your workflow.
*   **Intuitive UI:** A clean and user-friendly interface for a seamless experience.

This repository contains the source code for the DeXDo mobile application, built with Flutter.

## Architectural Overview

DeXDo is built on a modern and robust architecture to ensure scalability, performance, and maintainability.

*   **Database:** We use the **Isar Database**, a fast, transactional, and queryable NoSQL database for local data persistence.
*   **State Management:** We use **Riverpod** for state management, providing a clean and efficient way to manage application state and separate UI from business logic.
*   **Code Generation:** We use `build_runner` to generate necessary files for Isar. If you make changes to the data models in `lib/models/`, you must run the code generator.
