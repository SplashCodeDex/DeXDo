feat: Refined page transition with subtle scale and fade

This commit refines the page transition between the Home Screen and Add Task Screen.
It implements a subtle scale-in and fade-in for the incoming screen,
and a subtle scale-down and fade-out for the outgoing screen.
This creates a professional and smooth animation, inspired by iOS.

Includes:
- PageRouteBuilder with combined ScaleTransition and FadeTransition.
- Precise control over animation curves (elasticOut, easeOutCubic) and durations.
- Proper handling of both incoming and outgoing screen animations.
