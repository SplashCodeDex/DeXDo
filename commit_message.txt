fix: Resolve Flutter web compatibility errors and migrate from Isar to in-memory storage

## ðŸ”§ Major Changes:

### Database Migration (Web Compatibility)
- Remove Isar database dependencies (not compatible with web)
- Convert TodoRepository to in-memory storage with StreamController
- Migrate Todo model from Isar annotations to plain Dart objects
- Maintain full CRUD functionality and reactive updates

### Dependency Updates
- Remove: isar, isar_flutter_libs, isar_generator
- Add: path_provider ^2.1.1 (for future platform-specific storage)
- Update pubspec.yaml for cleaner dependencies

### Provider Architecture Refactor
- Change: FutureProvider<TodoRepository> â†’ Provider<TodoRepository>
- Update all screen files to work with synchronous providers
- Fix method calls: .value!.method() â†’ .method()

### Error Boundary Improvements
- Fix navigator context issues using Builder widget
- Resolve showDialog context problems
- Maintain proper error handling and user experience

### Model Simplification
- Clean Todo model of all Isar annotations
- Convert Id id = Isar.autoIncrement â†’ int? id (nullable)
- Preserve all business logic and helper methods

## âœ… Issues Resolved:
- MissingPluginException for path_provider in web
- Navigator operation context errors
- Failed compilation and runtime errors
- Web compatibility issues

## ðŸ§ª Testing:
- App successfully compiles and runs in Chrome browser
- Debug service connected and functional
- All Todo features preserved (CRUD, recurring tasks, search/filter)
- Error boundaries working properly

BREAKING CHANGE: Database storage is now in-memory only. For production,
consider implementing persistent storage based on platform requirements.
